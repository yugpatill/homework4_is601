# tests/test_calculations.py

"""
Unit tests for the calculator_calculations module using pytest.

This test suite covers both positive and negative scenarios for the Calculation
classes and the CalculationFactory. It ensures that calculations execute correctly,
the factory creates appropriate instances, and error handling behaves as expected.

Tests are organized following the AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern and adhere
to PEP8 standards for code style and formatting.
